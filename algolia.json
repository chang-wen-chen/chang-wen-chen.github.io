Switching branches involves changing directories. This can be simpler for beginners but less flexible for complex workflows. Git: Uses a decentralized branching model, where all branches exist within the same repository.","tags":["DVCS","Git","Mercurial"],"title":"Mercurial and Git","type":"post","url":"/2024/02/02/sw-scm-mercurial-git/","weight":0,"wordcount":333},{"author":null,"categories":["Thesaurus"],"content":null,"date":1706745600,"description":"","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706745600,"objectID":"76ffd48ca1f5ebce0363b4473fd8cb79","permalink":"https://chang-wen-chen.github.io/2024/02/01/diff_commitment_promise/","publishdate":"2024-02-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/2024/02/01/diff_commitment_promise/","section":"post","summary":"TLDR\nA commitment holds more weight than a simple promise They do differ in how they frame the distinction:\nEmphasis on intent:\nCommitment signifies a genuine desire to fulfill the promise, suggesting sincerity and motivation. Focus on strength:\nCommitment implies a stronger promise than one can readily deliver highlighting its ambitious nature. Contrast with indulgence:\nCommitment stands against indulgence, emphasizing dedication and perseverance as key differentiators. In essence, commitments go beyond empty promises, demonstrating a willingness to put in the effort and potentially exceed expectations.","tags":["English","Synonyms"],"title":"commitment and promise","type":"post","url":"/2024/02/01/diff_commitment_promise/","weight":0,"wordcount":87},{"author":null,"categories":["Life"],"content":null,"date":1706745600,"description":"","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706745600,"objectID":"c5fe3e6960aee5b54130e1767b1a5010","permalink":"https://chang-wen-chen.github.io/2024/02/01/hello-world/","publishdate":"2024-02-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/2024/02/01/hello-world/","section":"post","summary":"Learning","tags":["Life"],"title":"Welcome to Chang-Wen's Blog","type":"post","url":"/2024/02/01/hello-world/","weight":0,"wordcount":1},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"about/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://chang-wen-chen.github.io/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"About Me Chang Wen Chen is a CAD architecture and chip design engineer, offering 5+ years of experience in both hardware design as well as software development.
